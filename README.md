# Visualizing the Cooperative Election Study (CES/CCES)


This script processes and visualizes survey results from the [Cooperative Election Study (CES/CCES)](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/), demonstrating how different demographic coalitions voted in the 2008â€“2020 presidential elections. The first half of the code wrangles the survey microdata, while the second half outputs various charts.
